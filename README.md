# Module 14  Bikesharing in NYC

## Overview: 

### For this Project, I was tasked with analyzing data from a NYC bikesharing company called CitiBike.  Investors are looking into starting a similar bikesharing program in Des Moines Iowa and would like to see some visuals of trends regarding gender-specific usage, as well as ride length and time of day/week.  The big question…. Des Moines is not as big as NYC, can we interpret anything from the NYC data that can help us to predict a successful execution of bikesharing in Iowa?  I used Tableau graphics to provide the information I obtained for this project.

## Results:

### I determined that there were indeed lots of ‘hotspot’ locations in NYC as you can see by the geographic colored circles, with both increased size and richness of color depicting the most popular.

### Interestingly… the bike rides were pretty short, as you can see here in this visual portraying the number of trips (y-axis) vs. the trip duration in hours. Dramatically, most rides were <20minutes.

### Now who are taking these rides?? Ahhhh… as you can see in the next Figure, it is predominantly males over females.

### In fact, males outnumber females >2X (see story in Tableau).
###What times do these trips tend to take place, and does this affect which gender takes the rides?? Well, as you can see in the next figure, I plotted the hour of the day (0 refers to midnight), vs. the day of the week. This is a heatmap, and so intensity increases as the color deepens.  Clearly, the most riding takes place during the day on weekends, and during morning and afternoon work commute times (7-9AM, and 5-7PM).

### This trend is distributed in both genders as you can see here once I stratified the heatmap by gender. The pattern looks similar for each.

### Finally, alongside the fact that most riders were males, I also was able to determine that they were also mostly subscribers.  This is interesting as that indicates they were regular riders. You can see this in the next figure as I plotted Gender vs. Customer and Subscriber.

## Summary

### In conclusion, bikeshare services are very popular in large populous areas, where driving and parking cars may be more difficult.  I think the three takeaways from this data are to provide access to interesting areas which take ~20-30min of riding, incentivize more women somehow, and promote subscriptions and advertise access during commuter times!  In future, I would look at age distribution and geographic locale (are these people using the bikes for business or recreation???). This information would help with advertising angles.
